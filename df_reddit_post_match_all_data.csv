HypeTrainEngineer,in review. pepe and portugal were right i guess. it did go to messi. we all had a feeling it would too. france should be ashamed they were never really in it except when mbappe went off. which begs the question why werent they getting him the ball or working that left side from the start?🤔 credit to argentina's coach for their strategy. players overperformed per their talent so you got to give credit to that. martinez has been a monster at penalties all tournament and you just knew that if it was going to go to penalties it would be argentina. congrats messi he is the 🐐🐐🐐,2022-12-18 18:07:00+00:00,-1,0,0,2784,0,18039,578,Negative,0.9617501445467808,admiration

foyage347,in my opinion i believe messi was better then maradona before this (no disrespect to maradona it's very close) but in terms of the bigger legend to argentina i'd say messi has now overtaken him. doesn't matter tho both of them should be known as the players they were and are.,2022-12-18 18:03:23+00:00,3,0,0,2784,0,18039,276,Negative,0.8469725542448001,neutral
Shot-Spray5935,that's not the right question though. had messi not won the wc for argentina the argentinians would have always compared him to maradona and criticize him for not being able to do what maradona did. now they're going to shut up. messi is the better footballer but maradona in my humble opinion was more talented than messi. diego armando wasted his prodigious talent to a large extent. he also played in an era when skill players weren't protected. if messi played in the 80's he'd be murdered he would not last 2 seasons in europe.,2022-12-18 18:16:01+00:00,3,0,0,2784,0,18039,532,Positive,0.9888552805509669,disapproval

Brainhead_loser,"if you like crichton, then try the the remembrance of the earth's past by cixin liu, if you are into ya sci-fi, but not hunger games type garbage more like hardcore time travel sci-fi but a little bit geared towards adults of a younger age then try the timeriders series by alex scarrow. i don't really like horror but i love lovecraft's take on it. i am currently reading stoner by john williams, and if you are into classics i highly recommend just casually going through anton chkeov and the idiot by dostoevsky, but be warned it makes for pretty slow reading. if you are weird confessionals, there's always karl ove knausgård and if you are into crime books, there's the hypnotist by lars kepler.",2022-12-18 18:19:23+00:00,2,0,1,2784,0,18039,700,Positive,0.9990849588941347,approval
