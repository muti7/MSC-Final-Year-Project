@BICYCL3,"2014: argentina made it to the final but lost 2018: france knocked out argentina and won the world cup 2022: argentina faces france in the world cup final, mbappe is the new kid on the block and he needs to prove himself as the new goat, but in order to be the goat, you must defeat the goat. after a hard fought battle mbappe proved his abilities after the ""money over passion"" saga he went through between the 2018 wc and the 2022 wc and went toe to toe with the strongest argentina team in decade ultimately losing to messi who proved he is far from done and is still able to play at a level transcendent to the highest level of football. this journey for was quiet the story, and it's even more amazing when you realize that argentina had to face the 2nd and 1st place teams from the 2018 wc back to back to be champions of the world, and when you realize that portugal were set to only face argentina in the final it truly tells you this tail is one to remember and what ultimately happened to portugal proved to us that our other king ronaldo is edging closer to the end as they were eliminated by morocco who broke all expectations eliminating spain, portugal, and belgium. then there's japan who showed us that asia is not far behind in the football world. 10/10 world cup",3,0,3,309300,0,0,20463015,realization

@PumaDBanjo,"i remember on this day, how i was rooting for argentina, first feeling great joy for the 2:0-lead, then slowly getting big fears of my hopes crushing down, then messi scored a second time to give argentina another lead, then this penalty, where mbappe scored another time, then this ultimate save from emiliano martinez. while he was not known very well before this tournament, he became a legend after saving argentina against australia, where he saved the crucial last strike, then in the quarter final against netherlands, where he played greatly in the penalty shootout, then he created this moment, where he became one of the greatest goal keepers in argentinian history, especially after he saved another penalty in the final shootout, then winning the golden gloves... i am truly glad, that i could live so long to have witnessed such an event, france was great as well, they deserved it too, but they won the title back in 2018, this is the main reason, why it feels like some kind of justice (yes, it's horrible to lose such a game after this great comeback, but i guess they'll be in more finals in the future world cups, while messi will never again play a world cup...). this match was a golden egg, hidden in the nest of this mainly criticised tournament, but still bright enough to shine through, making us think about a great day we once experienced close to the 22nd year after the new millennium has started. for all people who read this until the end: have a nice day and may the sun always shine above you! :d",30,0,2,309300,0,0,20463015,admiration

@leah.ludovici,"una considerazione però. mbappé ha avuto sulle sue spalle l’intera partita, è lui che ha portato la francia ai rigori finali, facendo ben 3 goal in pochissimo tempo. questa è stata una partita emozionante e intensa, anche e soprattutto grazie a lui. a mio parere i rigori finali di una partita sono la ciliegina sulla torta che migliora nettamente la partita, mette ansia e fa provare un sacco di emozioni. mbappé ha dato emozioni in una partita che secondo me sarebbe stata quasi totalmente come tutte le altre (eccetto ovviamente l’emozione in se nel sapere che quella era la partita finale dei mondiali) vincita meritatissima dell’argentina, ma mbappé è stato una bestia, e chi lo nega ha i prosciutti sugli occhi, e chi lo prende per il c%lo dopo aver visto la sua performance strabiliante non capisce assolutamente niente.",0,0,1,309300,0,0,20463015,neutral

@rafaelecattonar1506,"do you want a proof the world cup was rigged? 1) infantino the fifa boss who lives in qatar said it would be ""an injustice"" if messi would end his career without an world cup 2) the organizer of the tournament in qatar said that seeing messi lift the cup in his country qatar would be ""very emotional"" 3) psg boss comes from qatar and is a big friend of qatari prince. the one who gave messi the cloak. 4) when qatari prince gave him the cloak it was like ""i have done this for you. i own you"" 5) 5 penalties in 7 matches. always the one to unblock the match and made argentinian team more relaxed. the point is the referee awaited for the argentinian team to go inside the box then give them a penalty. i'm not saying all of them were incorrect, but the plan was to give them a penalty regardless whether or not it was a real penalty. 6) argentina behaviour against netherlands. paredes should have been expelled. he had two yellow cards, but remained on the field. also dibu martínez and messi should have been expelled. messi touched the ball with his hand and didn't have a yellow card. and his words to the referee should have prevented him to play the final, too. the accusation of pepe saying i bet everything that argentina will be world champion. the accusation of bruno fernández asking why there's no portuguese referee and they play in uefa champions league. the accusation of de jong ex teammate of messi saying messi should have had a yellow card. the accusation of modric about to the referee saying there was no penalty and that penalty changed the match. 7) psg sponsor is qatar airways. messi has a contract with pepsi which is one of the main sponsors of qatar world cup. 8) the two main superstars of france and argentina play in psg. 9) the argentinian mascot of 1978 appears many times in the video of la 'eeb the mascot of qatar. 10) during the opening ceremony they played the song of argentinian supporters. 11) fifa successfully predicted the winner of world cup since 2010 in his videogame. they were always correct. 2010 spain, 2014 germany, 2018 france, 2022 argentina. 12) french and dutch teams being sick just one day before the match and argentina having no problems. 13) argentinian team behaviour during penalties against netherlands and france. 14) fifa making two posts in its official account. one with cr7 photo asking ""did you like this world cup?"" the other with a photo of messi saying ""the legacy is complete. now we have the goat. the debate is finished"". fifa had to delete both messages because they were disrespectful not only to cr7 but also to other players of the past. 15) fifa saying for many years ""the only thing messi is missing is a world cup"" 16) more poster and images of messi in qatar than any other player. 17) fifa narrative ""will marocco reach the semifinals? will cr7 score in his fifth world cup? will a south american country finally win the world cup against an european team?"" 18) in the opening of qatar world cup you see in second 33 the flags of france and argentina in the lusail stadium. 19) many people ""predicted"" that argentina would have had a penalty in the first 30 minutes. 20) the way argentinian players celebrated their victory by denigrating mbappé both in their room and in argentina. specially dibu martínez. that's not a proof but celebrating a victory disrespecting the adversary is not the way a true winner celebrate. 21) fifa didn't know whether or not argentina would play well. that's why they decided to help the team as much as possible. 22) in some actions when france had the advantage the referee decided to give a free kick, instead. do you think it wasn't rigged?",2,0,8,309300,0,0,20463015,neutral

@carlosdeciobraga270,"imprensa internacional, o segundo gol de messi deveria ter sido anulado pelo fato de atletas reservas da argentina estarem dentro de campo antes da bola ultrapassar a linha argentina foi beneficiada pela arbitragem. a imprensa internacional repercutiu nesta segunda-feira (19) um ‘flagra’ divulgado nas redes sociais pelo perfil ‘sportbible’ que mostra atletas reservas da seleção sul-americana à frente da linha lateral antes que a finalização de messi, no terceiro gol, tivesse atravessado a linha do gol, algo ‘estritamente proibido’ na regra do futebol.a publicação reiterou que, caso as regras do esporte fossem aplicadas de maneira rigorosa, o gol argentino deveria ter sido anulado e seria marcado um tiro livre direto a favor da frança. lei número 3 do parágrafo 9 das leis do futebol. “se, após a marcação de um gol, o árbitro perceber, antes do jogo recomeçar, que uma pessoa adicional estava em campo no momento em que o gol foi marcado: o árbitro deve anular o gol se o suplente for: jogador, suplente, substituído, expulso ou dirigente da equipe que fez o gol; o jogo deve ser reiniciado com um tiro livre direto no local onde estava a pessoa extra”, diz a definição. resumo: brasil 5 estrelas – argentina 3 asterisco (***) penalti inexistente, segundo os profissionais de arbitragem. o árbitro matou o contra ataque da frança, a regra diz que deve dar prosseguimento em vantagem do prejudicado, eram 4 jogadores da frança contra 2 da argentina, var pra que? a copa foi decidida em um erro de todos os árbitros (7), não aplicando a regra do jogo. quanto a 2021...pelé foi perguntado depois da final da copita america 2021: o brasil de 70 ganha dessa argentina? ""ganha de 2 a 0."" só 2 a 0?... sim, a maioria já passou dos 70 anos kakajajajajajkakakakakjajajkakakakakakjajajajajajajajajaaaakakakakakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk",0,0,0,309300,0,0,20463015,neutral

@KirillGrigorev,"two minutes of highlights cannot do this match justice. it needs a solid ten at least; the context surrounding the key moments is just as important, the dominance of argentina for most of the regulation time, the early subs of griezmann and giroud, then the french at the turn of the heel looking like an entirely different team has just entered the chat, then the drama of last ditch goals from each side in et. this has set a new bar for me for what a truly great game is, and i think most of us can agree has delivered everything anyone could ask for on top of the adrenaline: mbappe's hat trick, incredible goalkeeping on both sides, and messi completing his arc with the trophy. i wanted to see the french and mbappe to succeed too, but they might still get their chance while for messi it was probably the last tournament of this size. it all turned out for the best.",0,0,0,309300,0,0,20463015,admiration
