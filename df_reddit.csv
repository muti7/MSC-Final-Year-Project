Rare-Cockroach-4979,"This will either be tragic end to Messis National-Team career, or a marvelous ending of something like a good book.
The wonder-kid from Rosario, who signed his first Barca contract written on a napkin, the most talented player that ever graced the earth, taking it home at his final chance.

And he hast to do it against the strongest national team there is, at 35. This is some anime shit. 

Make it happen, so I have a good story for my grandkids.

Edit: I cried like a little bitch. That was the best game, in any sport, I have ever seen in my life.
Been supporting this man since Ronaldinho assisted this mans first Goal in a Barca jersey. Little did I know I was watching the greatest that will ever touch a ball. Diego Maradona is smiling from above.",2022-12-18 14:16:25,123,0,8,2784,0,18039

Both France and Argentina  now also have the opportunity to add a third to their tally.

 France have won the FIFA World Cup title twice, in 1998 at home and in 2018 in Russia.

Argentina are looking for their third World Cup since Diego Maradona led La Albiceleste to glory in 1986
(Argentina is a two-time world champion, winning the title in 1978 and 1986).

So happy to see Messi and Mbappe performing this well in the final. I remember the first game Messi played in Barca. To have witnessed his career and see him this close to a World Cup, while performing this well, at this age, in a final is a privilege.

Mbappe, who has been phenomenal since he was a teenager, has been such joy as well

McBruceWX5,"Amazing how we cannot see backwards through an exciting ending to the drabness of the first 75 minutes.  The “most exciting match in football history” began with one team not showing up for five-sixths of regulation and was an utter disappointment to that point.  Not just because France didn’t show up, but because countless hard fouls in midfield were ignored by the referee, who could have calmed things down with a few yellows.  One lesson every coach should learn from this game to instill in all players is this: if you are beaten fairly on the pitch, it’s OK to try to get back into the play, but understand that everyone, especially the referee, saw you get beaten and you will never, ever, get away with a foul trying to recover, so keep it absolutely clean.",2022-12-19 16:40:40,4,0,0,2784,0,18039

- Di Maria started stumbling on his own legs on purpose to get the penalty. That penalty was BS.


- Argentina players were taking cheap shots against players and GK constantly. 


- Messi did not get fouled in that header challenge. He recklessly challenged a ball that the French player easily had (French player was already under the ball, with his head on it, 1.5 feet above Messi) but messy gets special privileges.


- Giroud didn't deserve to be subbed, they're just using him as a scapegoat because he isn't very fast.


- Still, France doesn't deserve the W with how they are playing.

---

- apparently Giroud had knee trouble.

- Frence players acting like they don't really care about delivering an end result individually, just going through the motions. ""well, I tried to... <cross, complete pass, defend in the midfield, press their defense>""",2022-12-18 16:09:53,0,0,2,2784,0,18039

HypeTrainEngineer,In review.  Pepe and Portugal were right i guess.  It did go to messi.  We all had a feeling it would too.  France should be ashamed they were never really in it except when mbappe went off.  Which begs the question why werent they getting him the ball or working that left side from the start?🤔  credit to Argentina's coach for their strategy.  Players overperformed per their talent so you got to give credit to that.  Martinez has been a monster at penalties all tournament and you just knew that if it was going to go to penalties it would be Argentina.

United-Radio7672,"I wouldn't go that far to say it was the best final ever, for 80 mins one team didn't get a shot attempt - it was almost a snooze fest for anyone supporting Les Blues. 93s of thrills does not make the best game ever. It was one of the most incredible matches I've watched and the resolve of Argentina to gather itself and still manage a third goal and then win it, deservedly so. Most teams would have collapsed at 2-2 and 3-3. Messi is the best footballer of all time.",2022-12-18 22:52:57,3,0,2,2784,0,18039

Happened versus Croatia. Happened again versus France. Bought and paid. Nothing is sacred, someone has paid for the strings to give Messi a penalty kick each game and it’s sucks to see.

Diego Armando wasted his prodigious talent to a large extent. He also played in an era when skill players weren't protected. If Messi played in the 80's he'd be murdered he would not last 2 seasons in Europe.",2022-12-18 18:16:01,3,0,0,2784,0,18039

I feel that it was overall a very fair match. There were some bad calls here and there but it was there for both sides. 

I shed tears when Mbappe scored his hat trick because I had wanted the game to end on Messi's goal, but it certainly made for a more interesting and intense finale.

You think this shit wasnt a penalty? And how do you justify a yellow to the french player? He got tropped, even if you believed that it was a legal one it definitely tripped him lol. And no VAR for this? Meanwhile he calls that penalty for Argentine. What do you call that?....? not cheating??? Just consistrnt mistakes in favour of argentine? Its suspicious to say the least.

SkertSkertSkert,"We just call that a free kick, a penalty only refers to when a foul is committed in the defending teams box against the attacking team and is taken from the penalty spot. 

But on the offside rule, you'll often hear of the defending team playing 'a high line' where the defenders are on the halfway line or just inside their own half. This is to maximise the space in-between the second last man and the goals so if a player gets past their line they've still got 50 yards or so to go. 

We penalise the attacking team as they're making the mistake by making a run before the ball is kicked. The defending team are positioned correctly if they hold their line until the last possible moment. 

If the defenders fucked up their positioning then they would move back towards their goal before the ball had been played, therefore leaving the player onside and the attackers would be 'rewarded' in this situation.",2022-12-18 15:24:15,1,0,1,2784,0,18039

MakeshiftHoudini,"He’s an excellent player, don’t get me wrong.

But it seems as though he needs his team to do well to really fire on all cylinders himself. A bit like George Ford of English rugby (if you watch). Controls the game if they’re winning, but struggled in the harder fought ones.

MakeshiftHoudini,"Yes he was getting rinsed, but he was trying man, Mbappe wasn’t getting rinsed because he was doing fuck all on the pitch. Mbappe’s positioning is nearly as detrimental as Dembele. I guess you can only see what’s happening within 1m radius of the ball if you can’t see that. 

A target man is always required, he was doing a lot defensively, and when they get a odd cross Giroud always found himself on the end of them throughout the tournament. (Literally how they beat England)

 >The Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal  was a sports scandal that occurred during a Test match between England and Pakistan at Lord's, London, in August 2010. The scandal centered on three members of Pakistan's national cricket team, who were convicted of taking bribes from a bookmaker, Mazhar Majeed, to deliberately bowl no-balls at certain pre-arranged moments during the Test. Undercover reporters from News of the World secretly videotaped Mazhar Majeed accepting money and informing the reporters that Pakistani fast bowlers Asif and Amir would deliberately bowl no-balls at specific points during the game.

I can’t believe I have to explain this, but Giroud is what they call a target man. His job is to get into the box and wait for service in the form of crosses. He doesn’t track back, he doesn’t play defense.

When your team can’t get possession and can’t cross the ball in, there’s no point in having a player who can’t get the ball and won’t help you defensively.

Even though we didn’t win, it was an amazing game to watch. I was screaming at that Mbappé standard goal. France did not come into the game with their head on right. They played from the second half on. 

If we went out there and actually played the first half, I think we would have won it. Unfortunately, we were playing games that first half. Playing way too defensively which meant we didn’t even get a shot on goal in the first half (if I remember right) and then we just had some shit passes that turned over possession and gave them clear runs of the goal. 

We didn’t lose because it’s rigged, we lost because we only played 80 minutes of a 120 minute game. Honestly they should be embarrassed. But also proud that they were able to bring it back the way they did and give us an amazing game.",2022-12-18 18:43:14,0,0,1,2784,0,18039

McBruceWX5,"I think a solution that should be tried somewhere is having a shootout after ninety and then playing extra time.  If tied after extra time, the winner of the shootout takes it.  You would have one team knowing they need the next goal at all times: the shootout winner would work to preserve the tie but cannot put in three defenders for forwards, because if they concede they now need to score to take back the lead.  Some of the wildest matches I have seen is where each goal in an extra time with the away goals rule in effect changes the outcome and switches the narrative.  It may have drawbacks, but it should be tried somewhere to find out.  Just the idea of a shootout after every draw is great fun.

Is this the first time you are watching sports? Because you are not getting what I am saying. Players are given more leeway in games like this to be physical compared other games of lesser importance. This is what I meant when I say that the ref is showing restraint on the cards.

The physicality of the game was allowed ***on both teams***. You are presuming that the ref only allowed physical plays on Argentina but not on France. That was not the case. The ref was fair to all the players and everyone was allowed to a bit physical, so how is that protecting Argentina when it also benefit France? 

Reffing is not an exact science. The idea of ""if a player deserves a red"" can be flexible. In games a big as these, the plays that deserves red cards are taken to mean the most egregious of plays only. If you dont want contact on games, go watch chess.

Other refs will give yellows for excessive diving. 

I personally don't see how anyone who doesn't have a connection to Argentina could support the team. If the French played the same as Argentina, I believe the French would shun them",2022-12-18 22:03:35,1,0,1,2784,0,18039

Saying something is rigged is implying that the ref is intentionally calling the game for a specific team and that they are intentionally manipulating the game to do it. 

Just because a ref missed a call, that doesn’t make it rigged. Hell, those people have been doing their job probably way longer than you’ve been watching from your TV AND the amount of technology their support has to make sure they’re making the right calls makes it pretty hard to call it rigged when you have no evidence on your side. 

Please give me something that shows the ref intentionally manipulated the game for Argentina.

I am sure that I'm the one making incoherent arguments, when even a fly can see that Argentina has been getting pushed from the beginning. Tons of people have been talking about it, and ofc even in the final there were absurd/game changing decisions.

Was there a penalty against Poland? What about Netherlands? Croatia? And ofc, the comical one today against France?

Half of Argentina should've been suspended just for that Netherlands game. It was incredible the referees let them off the hook for that.

I don't hate any team, what I hate is blatant cheating. And that's what Argentina did through the whole tournament.

Brainhead_loser,"If you like Crichton, then Try the The Remembrance of the Earth's Past by Cixin Liu, if you are into YA sci-fi, but not hunger games type garbage more like hardcore time travel sci-fi but a little bit geared towards adults of a younger age then try the Timeriders series by Alex Scarrow. I don't really like horror but I love Lovecraft's take on it. I am currently reading Stoner by John Williams, and if you are into classics I highly recommend just casually going through Anton Chkeov and The Idiot by Dostoevsky, but be warned it makes for pretty slow reading. If you are weird confessionals, there's always Karl Ove Knausgård and if you are into crime books, there's The Hypnotist by Lars Kepler.",2022-12-18 18:19:23,2,0,1,2784,0,18039
